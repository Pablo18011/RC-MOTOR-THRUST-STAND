# Project
**Warning a fast-spinning propeller can do a lot damage, very quickly!!**

**Treat this project and my code with caution!!**

**Any time there is power applied to the ESC and motor assume the propeller will start up at any time and without any warning!!**

[I build and fly RC freestyle quadcopters and RC planes](https://www.youtube.com/@pablofpv/featured). I needed a way to test RC motor power characteristics, to help me choose the correct motor for a particular build. Commercial versions are available; however, these can be expensive. 
I set out to build a simple RCMTS, using kitchen scales and an angle bracket, but then I thought, maybe I could do better and learn something along the way?

My version is based on an Arduino Nano and uses a load cell HX711
amplifier circuit to measure the grams of thrust produced by a hobby RC motor and propeller combination.

I started with a digital scale tutorial.
This taught me how the load cell and code work to produce a measurement that can be viewed through Serial Monitor or on a small OLED display.
I built a breadboard version of the digital scale and calibrated the load cell.
I then built a simple PWM motor control circuit, when I understood how they both worked, I incorporated what I had 
Learnt and developed my own code.
# Components
Arduino Nano, 5KG Load Cell + HX711 Amplifier, I2C 2004 20X4 LCD Module Display, 10K Linear Potentiometer, 3 x Push Button Switches,
3 x 10 kÎ© Â±5% Resistors (pulldown), Turnigy Plush 30amp (Any standard PWM ESC), LED, buzzer, 330Î© resistor, Pin headers and Dupont Jumper Wires,
Aluminium bar, nuts and bolts, motor mount, motor.

My load cell is mounted on a strip of aluminium bar drilled to match the load cell and a spare Quadcopter arm drilled and fitted
to the other side of the load cell.I then clamp this into a heavy vice.

 # Operation
 I started with a [digital scale tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-load-cell-hx711/), which uses a 5KG load cell and HK711 amplifier.

The first thing to do is calibrate the load cell with a known weight and change the calibration
Factor in the code. 
I modified the code to display thrust in grams on an IIC/I2C/TWI 2004 20X4 LCD display.
I used analogRead a 10k linear potentiometer to map the values to PWM.
The output is determined by the potentiometer setting or the PWM pre-set, sent to a 
standard PWM ESC, in turn controls an RC motor.

Three push buttons are used for Tare, Safe Start and PWM pre-set.
Tare, is used to zero the load cell in relation to any deviation.
Safe Start, I added as a safety factor, so you have to push a button before the Arduino will
Output a PWM signal to the ESC.
PWM pre-set, used to output set PWM values for timed intervals 1250us, 1500us, 1750us and 2000us, for 2 secs each. 
This gives a repeatable bench mark, when comparison testing different motors.
The buzzer and LED are used as a start-up warning.

This version can be combined with a separate RC power meter and used to test different RC motor and propeller combination outputs.

# The Code
I used [Arduino IDE V 2.0.4](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to create and compile the code.
Please bear in mind I have taught myself to code and Iâ€™m still learning.
I also do this for my enjoyment and to put something back into the community ðŸ˜Š.
Credit to [Random Nerd Tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-load-cell-hx711/), I started with this to learn how a digital scale works.
I used the code to calibrate my load cell and combined with PWM control
to create my own code.




# Improvements?
Include voltage and current in the display?
DShot instead of PWM?
Ramp mode?
Optimize/simplify the code?

Coming soon... 
[RCMTS v2.0 !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEHoqFxafgg)


This uses a resistor voltage divider circuit, ACS758LCB-050B-PFF-T 50A Hall Current Sensor and a
precision LM4040 4.096V Voltage Reference Breakout.
With additional code, this allows the display of voltage and current in the range of 30V DC - 50 Amp.
