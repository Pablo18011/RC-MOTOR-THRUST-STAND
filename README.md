# Project
**Warning a fast-spinning propeller can do a lot damage, very quickly!!**

**Treat this project and my code with caution!!**

**Any time there is power applied to the ESC and motor assume the propeller will start up at any time and without any warning!!**

I build and fly RC freestyle quadcopters and RC planes. I needed a way to test RC motor power characteristics, to help me choose the correct motor for a particular build. Commercial versions are available; however, these can be expensive. 
I set out to build a simple RCMTS, using kitchen scales and an angle bracket, but then I thought, maybe I could do better and learn something along the way?

My version is based on an Arduino Nano and uses a load cell HX711
amplifier circuit to measure the grams of thrust produced by a hobby RC motor and propeller combination.

I started with a digital scale tutorial.
This taught me how the load cell and code work to produce a measurement that can be viewed through Serial Monitor or on a small OLED display.
I built a breadboard version of the digital scale and calibrated the load cell.
I then built a simple PWM motor control circuit, when I understood how they both worked, I incorporated what I had 
Learnt and developed my own code.
# Components
Arduino Nano, 5KG Load Cell + HX711 Amplifier, I2C 2004 20X4 LCD Module Display, 10K Linear Potentiometer, 3 x Push Button Switches
Turnigy Plush 30amp (Any standard PWM ESC), LED, buzzer, 330Î© resistor, Pin headers and Dupont Jumper Wires,
Aluminium bar, nuts and bolts, motor mount, motor.

My load cell is mounted on a strip of aluminium bar drilled to match the load cell and a spare Quadcopter arm drilled and fitted
to the other side of the load cell.I then clamp this into a heavy vice.
